# 1. Introduction

- **CloudFront uses Edge Location to cache content, and therefore bring more of your content closer to your viewers to improve read performance.**
- **You can use AWS WAF web access control lists (web ACLs) to help minimize the effects of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. For additional protection against DDoS attacks, AWS also provides AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced.**
- Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- **Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge.**
- Improves users experience.
- 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations).
- DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall.

## 1.1. Origins

- **S3 bucket:**
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge.
  - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC).
    - OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI).
    - You want to enforce users to access the website only through CloudFront.
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3).
- **Custom Origin (HTTP):**
  - Application Load Balancer.
  - EC2 instance.
  - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website).
  - Any HTTP backend you want.

# 2. CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

- CloudFront:
  - Global Edge network.
  - Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day).
  - **Great for static content that must be available everywhere.**
- S3 Cross Region Replication:
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen.
  - Files are updated in near real-time.
  - Read only.
  - **Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions.**

# 3. Caching

- Cache based on:
  - Headers.
  - Session Cookies.
  - Query String Parameters.
- The cache lives at each CloudFront **Edge Location**.
- You want to maximize the cache hit rate to minimize requests on the origin.
- Control the TTL (0 seconds to 1 year), can be set by the origin using the Cache-Control header, Expires header...
- You can invalidate part of the cache using the **CreateInvalidation** API.

# 4. Geo Restriction

- You can restrict who can access your distribution:
  - **Whitelist:** Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries.
  - **Blacklist:** Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries.
- The "country" is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database.
- Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content.

# 5. Signed URL / Signed Cookies

- You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world.
- To **Restrict Viewer Access**, we can create a CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie.
- How long should the URL be valid for?
  - Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes).
  - Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years.
- Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file).
- Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files).

## 5.1. Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL

- CloudFront Signed URL:
  - Allow access to a path, no matter the origin.
  - Account wide key-pair, only the root can manage it.
  - Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration.
  - Can leverage caching features.
- S3 Pre-Signed URL:
  - Issue a request as the person who pre-signed the URL.
  - Uses the IAM key of the signing IAM principal.
  - Limited lifetime.

## 5.2. Signed URL Process

- Two types of signers:
  - Either a trusted key group (recommended):
    - Can leverage APIs to create and rotate keys (and IAM for API security).
  - An AWS Account that contains a CloudFront Key Pair:
    - Need to manage keys using **the root account and the AWS console**.
    - Not recommended because you shouldn't use the root account for this.
- In your CloudFront distribution, create one or more trusted key groups.
- You generate your own public / private key:
  - The private key is used by your applications (e.g. EC2) to sign URLs.
  - The public key (uploaded) is used by CloudFront to verify URLs.

# 6. Pricing

- CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world.
- The cost of data out per edge location varies.

[CloudFront Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/)

## 6.1. Price Classes

- You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction.
- Three price classes:

1. Price Class All: all regions â€“ best performance.
2. Price Class 200: most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions.
3. Price Class 100: only the least expensive regions.

# 7. Multiple Origin

- To route to different kind of origins based on the content type
- Based on path pattern:
  - /images/\*
  - /api/\*
  - /\*

## 7.1. Origin Groups

- To increase high-availability and do failover.
- Origin Group: one primary and one secondary origin.
- If the primary origin fails, the second one is used.

# 8. Field Level Encryption

- Protect user sensitive information through application stack.
- Adds an additional layer of security along with HTTPS.
- Sensitive information encrypted at the edge close to user.
- Uses asymmetric encryption.
- Usage:
  - Specify set of fields in POST requests that you want to be encrypted (up to 10 fields).
  - Specify the public key to encrypt them.
