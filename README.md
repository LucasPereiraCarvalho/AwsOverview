## 1. Traditionally, how to build infrastructure

### 1.1. How websites work

- Clients have IP addresses.
- Servers have IP addresses.

### 1.2. What is a server composed of?

- Compute: CPU.
- Memory: RAM.
- Storage: Data.
- Database: Store data in a structured way.
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server.

### 1.3. IT Terminology

- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer
  networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

### 1.4. Problems with traditional IT approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center.
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance.
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time.
- Scaling is limited.
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure.
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire...).
- Can we externalize all this? **CLOUD**

## 2. What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need.
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

### 2.4. Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
  - Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility

- A region is a cluster of data centers.
- Most AWS services are region-scoped.

### 2.11. How to choose an AWS Region?

- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
- **Proximity** to customers: reduced latency.
- **Available services** within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.
- **Pricing** pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
- **Capacity is unlimited in the cloud, you do not need to worry about it. The 4 points of considerations when choosing an AWS Region are: compliance with data governance and legal requirements, proximity to customers, available services and features within a Region, and pricing.**

### 2.12. AWS Availability Zones

- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6).
- Example:
  - ap-southeast-2a
  - ap-southeast-2b
  - ap-southeast-2c
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
- They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.

### 2.13. AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & 11 Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries.
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency.

|        | 100 Mbps | 1Gbps    | 10Gbps   |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 10 TB  | 12 days  | 30 hours | 3 hours  |
| 100 TB | 124 days | 12 days  | 30 hours |
| 1 PB   | 3 years  | 124 days | 12 days  |

- AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations

  - If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

  - 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
  - 42 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery
- **Snowball Edge is best-suited to move petabytes of data and offers computing capabilities. Be careful, it's recommended to use a fleet of Snowballs to move less than 10PBs of data. Over this quantity, it's better-suited to use Snowmobile.**

#### 7.2.3. AWS Snowmobile

- Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
- Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)

2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you're done (goes to the right AWS facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped

### 7.4. What is Edge Computing?

- Process data while it's being created on an edge location
  - A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
- These locations may have
  - Limited / no internet access
  - Limited / no easy access to computing power
- We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
- Use cases of Edge Computing:
  - Preprocess data
  - Machine learning at the edge
  - Transcoding media streams
- Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)

## 8. Databases

### 8.1. Introduction

- Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits.
- Sometimes, you want to store data in a database...
- You can **structure** the data.
- You build **indexes** to efficiently **query / search** through the data.
- You define **relationships** between your **datasets**.
- Databases are **optimized for a purpose** and come with different features, shapes and constraints.

### 8.2. Relational Databases

- Looks just like Excel spreadsheets, with links between them!
- Can use the SQL language to perform queries / lookups.

### 8.3. NoSQL Databases

- NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases
- NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications.
- Benefits:
  - Flexibility: easy to evolve data model.
  - Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters.
  - High-performance: optimized for a specific data model.
  - Highly functional: types optimized for the data model.
- Examples: Key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases.

### 8.4. NoSQL data example: JSON

- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation.
- JSON is a common form of data that fits into a NoSQL model.
- Data can be nested.
- Fields can change over time.
- Support for new types: arrays, etc...

```
{
   "name":"John",
   "age":30,
   "cars":[
      "Ford",
      "BMW",
      "Fiat"
   ],
   "address":{
      "type":"house",
      "number":23,
      "street":"Dream Road"
   }
}
```

### 8.5. Databases & Shared Responsibility on AWS

- AWS offers use to **manage** different databases.
- **Databases** & Shared Responsibility on AWS include:
  - Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling.
  - Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades.
  - Operating System Patching is handled by AWS.
  - Monitoring, alerting.
- Note: many databases technologies could be run on EC2, but you must handle yourself the resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault tolerance, scaling...

### 8.6. AWS RDS Overview

- **Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a SQL managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It is suited for OLTP workloads.**
- RDS stands for Relational Database Service.
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS:
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

### 8.7. Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

- RDS is a managed service:
  - Automated provisioning, OS patching.
  - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
  - Monitoring dashboards.
  - Read replicas for improved read performance.
  - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery).
  - Maintenance windows for upgrades.
  - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal).
  - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1).
- BUT you can't SSH into your instances.

### 8.8. RDS Backups

- Backups are automatically enabled in RDS.
- Automated backups:
  - Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window).
  - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes.
  - => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago).
  - 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days).
- DB Snapshots:
  - Manually triggered by the user.
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want.

### 8.9. RDS - Storage Auto Scaling

- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically.
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically.
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage.
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage).
- Automatically modify storage if:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage.
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes.
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification.
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads.
- Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle).

### 8.10. RDS Deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ, Multi-Region

#### 8.10.1. Read Replicas

- Scale the read workload of your DB
- Can create up to 5 Read Replicas
- Data is only written to the main DB

#### 8.10.2. Multi-AZ

- Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
- Data is only read/written to the main database
- Can only have 1 other AZ as failover

#### 8.10.3. Multi-Region

- Multi-Region (Read Replicas)
- Disaster recovery in case of region issue
- Local performance for global reads
- Replication cost

#### 8.10.4. Resume

- **RDS Multi-AZ deployments main purpose is high availability, and RDS Read replicas main purpose is scalability.**
- **Moreover, Multi-Region deployments main purpose is disaster recovery and local performance.**

### 8.11. RDS - Read Replicas for read scalability

- Up to 5 Read Replicas.
- Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region.
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent.
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB.
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas.

#### 8.11.1. RDS - Read Replicas - Use Cases

- You have a production database that is taking on normal load.
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics.
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there.
- The production application is unaffected.
- Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

#### 8.11.2. RDS - Read Replicas - Network Cost

- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another.
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee.

#### 8.11.3. RDS - Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)

- SYNC replication.
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby.
- Increase availability.
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure.
- No manual intervention in apps.
- Not used for scaling.
- Multi-AZ replication is free.
- Note:The Read Replicas be setup as Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR).

#### 8.11.4. RDS - From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ

- Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB).
- Just click on "modify" for the database.
- The following happens internally:
  - A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  - Synchronization is established between the two databases

### 8.12. RDS Security - Encryption

- At rest encryption:
  - Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption.
  - Encryption has to be defined at launch time.
  - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted.
  - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server.
- In-flight encryption:
  - SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight.
  - Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database.
  - To enforce SSL:
    - PostgreSQL: rds.force_ssl=1 in the AWS RDS Console (Parameter Groups).
    - MySQL: Within the DB: `GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;`

### 8.13. RDS - Encryption Operations

- Encrypting RDS backups:
  - Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted.
  - Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted.
  - Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one.
- To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database:
  - Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database.
  - Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot.
  - Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot.
  - Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database.

### 8.14. RDS Security - Network & IAM

- Network Security:
  - RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one.
  - RDS security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2 instances) - it controls which IP / security group can communicate with RDS.
- Access Management
  - IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS (through the RDS API).
  - Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database.
  - IAM-based authentication can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL.

### 8.15. RDS - IAM Authentication

- IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- You don't need a password, just an authentication token obtained through IAM & RDS API calls.
- Auth token has a lifetime of 15 minutes.
- Benefits:
  - Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL.
  - IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB.
  - Can leverage IAM Roles and EC2 Instance profiles for easy integration.

### 8.16. RDS Security - Summary

- Encryption at rest:
  - Is done only when you first create the DB instance.
  - Or: unencrypted DB => snapshot => copy snapshot as encrypted => create DB from snapshot.
- Your responsibility:
  - Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB's SG.
  - In-database user creation and permissions or manage through IAM.
  - Creating a database with or without public access.
  - Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections.
- AWS responsibility:
  - No SSH access.
  - No manual DB patching.
  - No manual OS patching.
  - No way to audit the underlying instance.

### 8.17. Amazon Aurora

- **Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. It is a proprietary technology from AWS.**
- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced).
- **PostgreSQL and MySQL** are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database).
- Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS.
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128 TB.
- Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag).
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It's HA (High Availability) native.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient.
- Not in the free tier.

### 8.18. Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling

- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:
  - 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes.

### 8.21. Amazon ElastiCache Overview

- **Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy and run Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant server nodes in the cloud. ElastiCache caches are in-memory databases with high performance, low latency. They help reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads.**
- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases...
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached.
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency.
- Helps make your application stateless.
- Helps **reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads**.
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups.
- Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes.

### 8.22. ElastiCache - Solution Architecture - DB Cache

- Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache.
- Helps relieve load in RDS
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there.

### 8.23. ElastiCache - Solution Architecture - User Session Store

- User logs into any of the application.
- The application writes the session data into ElastiCache.
- The user hits another instance of our application.
- The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in.

### 8.24. ElastiCache - Redis vs Memcached

- REDIS:
  - Multi AZ with Auto-Failover.
  - Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability.
  - Data Durability using AOF persistence.
  - Backup and restore features.
- MEMCACHED:
  - Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding).
  - No high availability (replication).
  - Non persistent.
  - No backup and restore.
  - Multi-threaded architecture.

### 8.25. ElastiCache - Cache Security

- All caches in ElastiCache:
  - Do not support IAM authentication.
  - IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security.
- Redis AUTH:
  - You can set a "password/token" when you create a Redis cluster.
  - This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups).
  - Support SSL in flight encryption.
- Memcached:
  - Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced).

### 8.26. ElastiCache Replication

#### 8.26.1. Cluster Mode Disabled

- One primary node, up to 5 replicas.
- Asynchronous Replication.
- The primary node is used for read/write.
- The other nodes are read-only.
- One shard, all nodes have all the data.
- Guard against data loss if node failure.
- Multi-AZ enabled by default for failover.
- Helpful to scale read performance.

#### 8.26.2. Cluster Mode Disabled

- Data is partitioned across shards (helpful to scale writes).
- Each shard has a primary and up to 5 replica nodes (same concept as before).
- Multi-AZ capability.
- Up to 500 nodes per cluster:
  - 500 shards with single master.
  - 250 shards with 1 master and 1 replica.
  - ...
  - 83 shards with one master and 5 replicas.

### 8.27. Caching Implementation Considerations

- Read more at: https://aws.amazon.com/caching/implementation-considerations/
- **Is it safe to cache data?** Data may be out of date, eventually consistent.
- Is caching effective for that data?
  - Pattern: data changing slowly, few keys are frequently needed.
  - Anti patterns: data changing rapidly, all large key space frequently needed.
- Is data structured well for caching?
  - Example: key value caching, or caching of aggregations results.
- Which caching design pattern is the most appropriate?

### 8.28. Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside / Lazy Population

- Pros:
  - Only requested data is cached (the cache isn't filled up with unused data).
  - Node failures are not fatal (just increased latency to warm the cache).
- Cons
  - Cache miss penalty that results in 3 round trips, noticeable delay for that request.
  - Stale data: data can be updated in the database and outdated in the cache.

### 8.29. Write Through -Add or Update cache when database is updated

- Pros:
  - Data in cache is never stale, reads are quick.
  - Write penalty vs Read penalty (each write requires 2 calls).
- Cons:
  - Missing Data until it is added / updated in the DB. Mitigation is to implement Lazy Loading strategy as well.
  - Cache churn - a lot of the data will never be read.

### 8.30. Cache Evictions and Time-to-live (TTL)

- Cache eviction can occur in three ways:
  - You delete the item explicitly in the cache.
  - Item is evicted because the memory is full and it's not recently used (LRU).
  - You set an item time-to-live (or TTL).
- TTL are helpful for any kind of data:
  - Leaderboards.
  - Comments.
  - Activity streams.
- TTL can range from few seconds to hours or days.
- If too many evictions happen due to memory, you should scale up or out.

### 8.31. Final words of wisdom

- Lazy Loading / Cache aside is easy to implement and works for many situations as a foundation, especially on the read side.
- Write-through is usually combined with Lazy Loading as targeted for the queries or workloads that benefit from this optimization.
- Setting a TTL is usually not a bad idea, except when you're using Write- through. Set it to a sensible value for your application.
- Only cache the data that makes sense (user profiles, blogs, etc...).
- Quote: There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

## 10. Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale

### 10.1. What is CloudFormation?

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
  - I want a security group.
  - I want two EC2 instances using this security group.
  - I want an S3 bucket.
  - I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines.
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify.

**- CloudFormation are free of use, but you do pay for the resources created.**

- Infrastructure as code
  - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control.
  - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code.
- Cost
  - Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you.
  - You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template.
  - Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely.
- Productivity
  - Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly.

  - Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server.
  - It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US.
  - Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience.
- Disaster Recovery (DR):
  - If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)...
  - You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working.
  - A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application.
- Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

### 12.2. Global AWS Infrastructure

- **Route 53 features are (non exhaustive list): Domain Registration, DNS, Health Checks, Routing Policy**
- Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
- In AWS, the most common records are:
  - www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
  - www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6
  - search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
  - example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc...)

#### 12.4.1. Route 53 policies

- **Weighted Routing Policy is used to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.**

### 12.5. AWS CloudFront

- **CloudFront uses Edge Location to cache content, and therefore bring more of your content closer to your viewers to improve read performance.**
- **You can use AWS WAF web access control lists (web ACLs) to help minimize the effects of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. For additional protection against DDoS attacks, AWS also provides AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced.**
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
- Improves users experience
- 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
- DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall

### 12.6. CloudFront - Origins

- S3 bucket
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge
  - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
- Custom Origin (HTTP)
  - Application Load Balancer
  - EC2 instance
  - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
  - Any HTTP backend you want

### 12.7. CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

- CloudFront:
  - Global Edge network.
  - Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day).
  - Great for static content that must be available everywhere.
- S3 Cross Region Replication:
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen.
  - Files are updated in near real-time.
  - Read only.
  - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions.

### 12.8. S3 Transfer Acceleration

- **Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.**
- Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region.

### 12.9. AWS Global Accelerator

- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network.
- Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement).
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations.
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application.

### 12.10. AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront

- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world.
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
- CloudFront - Content Delivery Network:
  - Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos).
  - Content is served at the edge.
- Global Accelerator:
  - No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
  - Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP.
  - Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses.
  - Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover.

### 12.11. AWS Outposts

- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure.
- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
  - One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI, and AWS APIs).
  - One for their on-premises infrastructure.
- AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud.
- AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises.
- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security.

## 13. Cloud Integration

- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another.
- There are two patterns of application communication:
  1. Synchronous communications (application to application).
  2. Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application).
- Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic.
- What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually it's 10?
- In that case, it's better to decouple your applications:
  - using SQS: queue model.
  - using SNS: pub/sub model.
  - using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model.
- These services can scale independently from our application!

### 13.1. Amazon SQS - Standard Queue

- Oldest AWS offering (over 10 years old).
- Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decouple applications.
- Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second.
- Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days.
- No limit to how many messages can be in the queue.
- Messages are deleted after they're read by consumers.
- Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive).
- Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally.

### 13.2. Amazon Kinesis

- **Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. Kinesis offers four services: Data Firehose, Data Analytics, Data Streams, Video Streams.**
- Kinesis = real-time big data streaming.
- Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale.
- Kinesis Data Streams: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources.
- Kinesis Data Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, etc...
- Kinesis Data Analytics: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL.
- Kinesis Video Streams: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML.

### 13.3. Amazon SNS

- **Is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It uses a push-based system.**
- **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It uses a pull-based system.**
- The "event publishers" only sends message to one SNS topic.
- As many "event subscribers" as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications.
- Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages.
- Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic, 100,000 topics limit.

### 13.4. Amazon MQ

- **Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud.**
- SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services, and they're using proprietary protocols from AWS.
- Traditional applications running from on-premise may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS.
- When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ.
- Amazon MQ = managed Apache ActiveMQ.
- Amazon MQ doesn't "scale" as much as SQS / SNS.
- Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine (not serverless).
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (SQS) and topic features (SNS).

### 13.5. Integration - Summary

- SQS:
  - Queue service in AWS.
  - Multiple Producers, messages are kept up to 14 days.
  - Multiple Consumers share the read and delete messages when done.
  - Used to decouple applications in AWS.
- SNS:
  - Notification service in AWS.
  - Subscribers: Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile...
  - Multiple Subscribers, send all messages to all of them.
  - No message retention.
- Kinesis: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis.
- Amazon MQ: managed Apache MQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP protocols).
- **When using SQS or SNS, you apply the "decouple your applications" principle. This means that IT systems should be designed in a way that reduces interdependencies—a change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components.**
