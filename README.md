# Aws overview

## Traditionally, how to build infrastructure

### How websites work

- Clients have IP addresses.
- Servers have IP addresses.

### What is a server composed of?

- Compute: CPU.
- Memory: RAM.
- Storage: Data.
- Database: Store data in a structured way.
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server.

### IT Terminology

- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer
  networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

### Problems with traditional IT approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center.
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance.
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time.
- Scaling is limited.
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure.
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire…).
- Can we externalize all this? **CLOUD**

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need.
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

### You’ve been using some Cloud services

- Gmail
  - E-mail cloud service
  - Pay for ONLY your emails stored (no infrastructure, etc.)
- Dropbox
  - Cloud Storage Service
  - Originally built on AWS
- Netflix
  - Built on AWS
  - Video on Demand

### The Deployment Models of the Cloud

#### Private Cloud:

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- Complete control.
- Security for sensitive applications.
- Meet specific business needs.

#### Public Cloud:

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.

#### Hybrid Cloud:

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud

### The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service:
  - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Broad network access:
  - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
  - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- Measured service:
  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
  - Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

### Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
