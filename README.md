# Aws overview

## Traditionally, how to build infrastructure

### How websites work

- Clients have IP addresses.
- Servers have IP addresses.

### What is a server composed of?

- Compute: CPU.
- Memory: RAM.
- Storage: Data.
- Database: Store data in a structured way.
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server.

### IT Terminology

- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer
  networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network.

### Problems with traditional IT approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center.
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance.
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time.
- Scaling is limited.
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure.
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire…).
- Can we externalize all this? **CLOUD**

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need.
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

### You’ve been using some Cloud services

- Gmail
  - E-mail cloud service
  - Pay for ONLY your emails stored (no infrastructure, etc.)
- Dropbox
  - Cloud Storage Service
  - Originally built on AWS
- Netflix
  - Built on AWS
  - Video on Demand

### The Deployment Models of the Cloud

#### Private Cloud:

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- Complete control.
- Security for sensitive applications.
- Meet specific business needs.

#### Public Cloud:

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.

#### Hybrid Cloud:

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud

### The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service:
  - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Broad network access:
  - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
  - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- Measured service:
  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
  - Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

### Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

### Types of Cloud Computing

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - Highest level of flexibility
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

### Example of Cloud Computing Types

- Infrastructure as a Service
  - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
  - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service:
  - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
  - Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
- Software as a Service:
  - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
  - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

### Pricing of the Cloud – Quick Overview

- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing
  model
  - Compute:
    - Pay for compute time
  - Storage:
    - Pay for data stored in the Cloud
  - Data transfer **OUT** of the Cloud:
    - Data transfer IN is free
  - Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

### AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS Regions
- AWS Availability Zones
- AWS Data Centers
- AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence
- https://infrastructure.aws/

### AWS Regions

- AWS has Regions all around the world
- Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3…
- A region is a cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region-scoped

### How to choose an AWS Region?

- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- **Proximity** to customers: reduced latency
- **Available** services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
- **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

### AWS Availability Zones

- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). Example:
  - ap-southeast-2a
  - ap-southeast-2b
  - ap-southeast-2c
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters
- They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

### AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & 11 Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency

### Tour of the AWS Console

- AWS has Global Services:
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Route 53 (DNS service)
  - CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
  - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
  - Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
  - Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
  - Lambda (Function as a Service)
  - Rekognition (Software as a Service)
- Region Table: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services

### Shared Responsibility Model diagram

- AWS = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY OF THE CLOUD
- CUSTOMER = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY IN THE CLOUD
- https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

### AWS Acceptable Use Policy

- https://aws.amazon.com/aup/
- No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content
- No Security Violations
- No Network Abuse
- No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse

## IAM - Identity and Access Management

### IAM: Users & Groups

- IAM = Identity and Access Management, **Global service**.
- **Root account** created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared.
- **Users** are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
- **Groups** only contain users, not other groups.
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.

### IAM: Permissions

- **Users or Groups** can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies define the **permissions** of the users.
- In AWS you apply the **least privilege** principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs.

### IAM: Policies Structure

- Consists of
  - **Version**: policy language version, always include "YYYY-MM-DD"
  - **Id**: an identifier for the policy (optional)
  - **Statement**: one or more individual statements (required)
- Statements consists of
  - Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
  - Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
  - Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
  - Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies
  - Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to
  - Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)
